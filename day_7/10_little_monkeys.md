## 10 Little Monkeys

Create a file named 10_little_monkeys.rb and within that file, write a program that will print the following nursery rhyme, but for *10* monkeys.

> Three little monkeys jumping on the bed,  
> One fell off and bumped his head,  
> Mama called the doctor and the doctor said,  
> "No more monkeys jumping on the bed!"
>
> Two little monkeys jumping on the bed,  
> One fell off and bumped his head,  
> Mama called the doctor and the doctor said,  
> "No more monkeys jumping on the bed!"
>
> One little monkey jumping on the bed,  
> He fell off and bumped his head,  
> Mama called the doctor and the doctor said,  
> "Get those monkeys right to bed!"

### Bonus
Can you write the program so that it will run for any number of monkeys?

### Notes  
- change input integer to string...
- assign variable to 10 (or ability to do any number value...)
- prompt for a number of monkeys
- output rhyme with 'num' little monkeys  
- if num = 1 get those monkeys right to bed   
- if num = 0, no result, return string, end
