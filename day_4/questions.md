## Day 4 Questions  

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?  
   **Methods** are action processes associated with objects. We can use methods to manipulate and modify the data properties and behaviour of an object in the codebase. Methods can be repeatedly called upon various times in a codebase, saving time, effort and minimising room for error when working with numerous variables and objects.  

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.  
   ```ruby
   def hello
     puts "Sam I am."
   end
   ```

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.  
   ```ruby
   def hello_someone(name)
     puts "#{name} I am"
   end
   ```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?  
   ```ruby
   hello_someone("Nicola")
   Nicola I am
   ```  

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
   I've enjoyed learning about methods so far, and I'd like to zone in more on knowing when to use `p` vs `puts` and `print`.  
   I'd also like to explore more about using booleans in methods.
