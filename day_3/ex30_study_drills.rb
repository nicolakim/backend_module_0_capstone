# 1. Try to guess what `elsif` and `else` are doing.
# `elsif` is an alternative with corresponding result, to `if`.
# `else` is saying "in all cases when neither `if` or `elsif` works, do this", with it's own result.

# 2. Change the numbers of `cars`, `people`, and `trucks` and then trace through each `if-statement` to see what will be printed.

# 3. Try some more complex boolean expressions like `cars > people || trucks < cars`.

# 4. Above each line write an English description of what the line does.
# yep (see ex30rb)
